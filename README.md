### 👨🏻‍💻 About me
I'm a Full Stack Engineer with three (3) years of experience programming software (Front-End & Back-End). I'm passionate about being Full Stack. During my career, I have worked for several clients and companies developing E-commerce and adding new functionalities to their applications.

  * Report panel to view in detail each customer record
  * REST API server to serve information to the reporting dashboard
  * Creation of a PostgreSQL database with an architecture to initially store the data of 30,000 customers
* 🛒 I builded the Front-End of a E-commerce with React.js using Next.js framework and Typescript
* 🗺️ Freight transport management and geolocation software built with React.js, React Native with Expo, Express.js, MySQL and Google Maps API

### ⭐ My specialties in software development
